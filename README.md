# 🏀 Analyzing the Impact of Luka Dončić on LeBron James' Performance
This project looks at how LeBron James’ game has changed since Luka Dončić joined the Lakers, focusing on shooting types, scoring efficiency, and play style. Using the hoopR package in R, I pulled play-by-play and player data to compare LeBron’s performance before and after Luka’s arrival. The project includes a mix of visualizations such as radar plots, boxplots, and a custom Lakers logo—all created from scratch in R. It highlights my ability to work with sports data, clean and analyze large datasets, and build clear, informative visuals. It also reflects my interest in using data to tell a story creatively. This project showcases the skills I learned on R through my undergraduate tenure, with a motivation to learn more. 

# 🏀 SetUp
Using R and the hoopR package, I extracted player box scores and play-by-play data to evaluate LeBron’s metrics before and after Luka joined the team. The project categorized shot types, calculated usage rates, and compared field goal percentages, average shot distances, and shot frequencies. Visualizations such as radar plots (using ggradar), boxplots (ggplot2), and styled tables (gt) were used to present findings.

The analysis revealed that while LeBron’s overall stats remained steady, his role shifted—he took more catch-and-shoot attempts and had slightly lower usage and assist rates. A key limitation is the small sample size of games played together, which may increase variance in the post-Luka data.
